CMake Warning at C:/opencv/build/OpenCVConfig.cmake:190 (message):
  Found OpenCV Windows Pack but it has no binaries compatible with your
  configuration.

  You should manually point CMake variable OpenCV_DIR to your build of OpenCV
  library.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:55 (find_package)


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:55 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    C:/opencv/build/OpenCVConfig.cmake

  but it set OpenCV_FOUND to FALSE so package "OpenCV" is considered to be
  NOT FOUND.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
